this is my cheatsheet
touch is for creating txt files 
mkdir or "make directory" command to make a folder
cat is for reading text files
echo is for repeating things
pwd is for printing working directory
ls lists files and folders in a directory
cd change directory to home folder
cd .. go back to previous. will move you one directory up in the filesystem
> s known as a "redirect." It takes the output of a command and puts it in a file
>> command, known as the redirect and append command, instead. 
        If there's already a file with text in it, this command can add text to the file without destroying and recreating it.
-i means to ignore capitalizations/case sensitivity
grep allows you to do searches in csv files 
mv moves files 
* have to go by command, item being commanded mv item_name place_moving_to
